Notes from my Integration and Fourier series course at the University Paris Cit√©.

The pdf is available [here](https://yag000.github.io/integration-notes/integration-notes.pdf).

If you suffer from dyslexia you can use this version over [here](https://yag000.github.io/integration-notes/integration-notes-dyslexia.pdf). If you still have trouble and you
think another font or font size would help, feel free to open an issue, I'll be happy to help.
